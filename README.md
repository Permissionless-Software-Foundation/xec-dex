`xec-dex` is a decentralized exchange for permissionless trading of [SLP tokens](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-token-type-1.md) and [NFTs](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-nft-1.md). Trading fees are incredibly small, compared to other DEX platforms. The software is based entirely on open protocols and open source software. It's not a '.com' website that you visit, but software you run on your own computer, in the confort of your own home. So long as you have an internet connection and the technical knowledge to run this software, no one can stop you from trading eTokens on the eCash blockchain. This software is maintained by the [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.cash/).

This is web server software that monitors the [P2WDB](http://p2wdb.com) for trading signals, to trade XEC and eTokens. It's inspired by the [SWaP Protocol](https://github.com/vinarmani/swap-protocol/blob/master/swap-protocol-spec.md).

This repository contains the back end code. The user interface is contained in the [xec-dex-ui](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/xec-dex-ui) repository.

**Warning**: This repository is under active development. Things will be constantly changing and breaking.
